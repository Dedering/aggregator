### Project Problem Statement and Plan

Hi Jonathan, based on your problem statement and discussion in class, I think your project will be a good challenge that meets the requirements of the course project. You may want to turn your problem statement/overview into a markdown file for prettier viewing within github.  Think of those prospective employers looking at your GitHub portfolio and use this as a way to show them what you've built/are going to build.

* Your schedule could use more detail. Break out the development process into smaller tasks. Some task ideas to get you started: design tables, create tables, populate tables with test data, design UI, document application flow, design classes, write weekly blog/wiki/status report, unit tests, logging, etc. Also include when you will you do your independent research and how/when it will be incorporated into the project.

You have a nice, diverse set of development skills and experience; I'm really looking forward to seeing that all come together in this application!
